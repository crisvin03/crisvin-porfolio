## Quick Setup (2 minutes):

### Step 1: Get Your Access Key
1. Go to [https://web3forms.com/](https://web3forms.com/)
2. Enter your email: `crisvin.habitsuela@sorsu.edu.ph`
3. Click "Get Access Key"
4. Check your email for the access key
5. Copy the access key (looks like: `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`)

### Step 2: Update Your Code
In `src/pages/Contact.jsx`, replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY` with your actual access key:

```javascript
access_key: 'a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890', // Your actual key here
```

### Step 3: Test
1. Save the file
2. Test the contact form
3. Check your email - you should receive the message!

## That's it! 
- No account creation needed
- No complex configuration
- Works immediately
- Emails go directly to your inbox

## Alternative: Use a Temporary Test Key
If you want to test immediately, you can use this temporary key (replace with your own later):
`YOUR_ACCESS_KEY` → `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`

But it's better to get your own key from web3forms.com for reliability.
